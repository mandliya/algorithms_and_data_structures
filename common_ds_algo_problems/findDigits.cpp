/**
 * You are given an integer N. Find the digits in this number that exactly divide N (division that leaves 0 as remainder) and display their count.
 * For N=24, there are 2 digits (2 & 4). Both of these digits exactly divide 24. So our answer is 2.
 *
 * Note
 *
 * If the same number is repeated twice at different positions, it should be counted twice,
 * e.g., For N=122, 2 divides 122 exactly and occurs at ones' and tens' position. So for this case, our answer is 3.
 * Division by 0 is undefined.
 *
 *
 * Input Format
 * The first line contains T (the number of test cases), followed by T lines (each containing an integer N).
 *
 * Constraints
 * 1≤T≤15
 * 0<N<1010
 * Output Format
 *
 * For each test case, display the count of digits in N that exactly divide N in a separate line.
 *
 * Sample Input
 *
 * 2
 * 12
 * 1012
 *
 * Sample Output
 * 2
 * 3
