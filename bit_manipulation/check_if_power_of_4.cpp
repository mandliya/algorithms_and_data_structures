/*
 * Check if a given number is power of 4 or not.
 * 
 * Approach: If a value is power of 4, it has to be power of 2 and
 * it will have set bits at even position (as the number is power of 2, it will have
 * only one set bit.) For example:
 * 4 (0100)
 * 16 (0001 0000)
 * 64 (0100 0000)
 * If a number is power of 2 then it would have only one set bit and that set
 * bit would be reset by the expression (n & (n-1)), thus if (n & (n-1)) == 0,
 * means n is power of 2.
 * Now, since we have one set bit and if it is at even position it would be
 * power of 4, to check if set bit is at even position, we should AND it with
 * expression 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 i.e. 0xAAAAAAAA. Notice we have
 * set bits at all odd positions (it is 0 indexed), thus if expression
 * (n & 0xAAAAAAAA) == 0, then we have that set bit at even position.
