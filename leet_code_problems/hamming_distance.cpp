/**
 The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which
 the corresponding bits are different.
 Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

 Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different

    int z = x ^ y;

    // Now just count set bits in z.
    int count = 0;
    while (z) {
        count += (z % 2);
        z >>= 2;
