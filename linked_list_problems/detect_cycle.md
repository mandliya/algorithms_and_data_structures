# Linked List Cycle
[Try the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

### Example 

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```
