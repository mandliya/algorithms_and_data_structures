/**
 * Huffman Encoding:
 * Huffman coding compresses data by using fewer bits to encode more frequently
 * occurring characters so that not all characters are encoded with 8 bits.
 * It is a way to assign binary codes to symbols that reduces the overall number of bits
 * used to encode a typical string of those symbols. 
 * For example, if you use letters as symbols and have details of the frequency of occurrence
 * of those letters in typical strings, then you could just encode each letter with a fixed number of bits,
 * such as in ASCII codes. You can do better than this by encoding more frequently occurring letters such as e and a,
 * with smaller bit strings; and less frequently occurring letters such as q and x with longer bit strings.
 * More details: https://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/poop/huff/info/
