/*
Given a list of unsorted integers, A={a1,a2,â€¦,aN}, Find the pair of elements that have the smallest absolute difference between them? If there are multiple pairs, find them all.
Input: N= Number of elements, followed by N elements.
Output: Output the pairs of elements with the smallest difference. If there are multiple pairs, output all of them in ascending order, all on the same line (consecutively) with just a single space between each pair of numbers. If there's a number which lies in two pair, print it two times
Example:
    Input : 4
            5 4 3 2
    Output: 2 3 3 4 4 5
